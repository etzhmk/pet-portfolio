# ðŸ§© Portfolio Website | Pet Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio â€” a small project where I played around with layout, animation, and design.
This is a pet project â€” a clean, responsive portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It reflects my visual taste, technical growth, and creative vibe.

- HTML5 & Semantic Markup  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Transitions)  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Responsive Design (Mobile-first)

##  Project Goals

- Build a portfolio from scratch without frameworks  
- Practice layout techniques and animations  
- Create a visual identity for myself as a developer  
- Explore personal style and design preferences
