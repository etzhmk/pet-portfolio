# Portfolio Website | Pet Project

> "Not your typical portfolio. No frameworks — just raw code and soul."

Welcome to my cyber-themed pet project.  
This site is a digital playground — a minimal, retro-futuristic portfolio built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Think of it as my personal node in the internet underground.

## Why This?
I wanted to create something that reflects my aesthetics and coding philosophy:
- No boilerplate.
- No fancy libraries.
- Just me and the browser.

This portfolio is inspired by:
- the rawness of early internet pages,
- the vibe of old operating systems,
- and the glitchy beauty of the analog-digital merge.

##  Tech Stack

- HTML5 & Semantic Markup  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Transitions)  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Responsive Design (Mobile-first)

##  Project Goals

- Build a portfolio from scratch without frameworks  
- Practice layout techniques and animations  
- Create a visual identity for myself as a developer  
- Explore personal style and design preferences

## About the Project
This is not a final version — it’s evolving like a living terminal.  
It's more of a vibe experiment than a corporate-ready layout.

But that’s the point.  
**It’s meant to feel like a corner of the web that belongs to *me***.
